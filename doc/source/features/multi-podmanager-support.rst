Multiple Podmanager Support
===========================

Overview
========

This feature helps in integrating all podmanagers from different vendors
i.e user doesn't need to deploy multiple valence for every podmanager.
It fills gap of switching between multiple podmanagers which is never easy
to manage different podmanager from every vendor. So, valence provide
convenient way to manage all podmanagers.
