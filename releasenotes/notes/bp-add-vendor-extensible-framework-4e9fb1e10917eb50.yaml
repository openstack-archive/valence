    Added extensibe framework inside valence to provide provision for the
    vendors who would like to manage the dis-aggregated hardware through
    valence , but does not support redfish. Basically, it redirect all
    conductor requests to respective podmanagers based on driver passed
    by vendors. Vendors have to write their own driver that involves
    mapping between valence apis and their hardware.
