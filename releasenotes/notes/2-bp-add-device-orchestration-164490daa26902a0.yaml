    Device Orchestration:

    Valence supports management of pooled resources and adds
    ability to attach/detach dynamically to nodes according
    to workload demand. New config option 'enable_periodic_sync'
    supported to sync resources from podmanager periodically.
    By default, periodic sync is disabled.
