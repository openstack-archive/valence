Components
**********

Valence follows the typical OpenStack project setup. The components are listed
below:

valence-api
-----------
A pecan based daemon to expose Valence REST APIs. The api service communicates
to the controller through AMQP.

valence-controller
--------------
The controller implements all the handlers for valence-api. It reads requests
from the AMQP queue, process it and send the reponse back to the caller.

valence-ui
--------
valence-ui provides a GUI interface to invoke Valence APIs.
