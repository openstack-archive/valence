==============
DB Development
==============

Valence uses Etcd as the management DB for handling multiple pod managers,
as well as underneath hardware resources info.
There is one root Etcd directory for the pod managers, named
"/pod_managers".
Each key-value pair under directory "/pod_managers" indicates
information about one pod manager.

.. NOTE::
      All db layer codes are located in valence/db.


Add a model for db
------------------

Models are defined in the valence/db/models.py file. A new model
should be updated there.

To add a example model for Etcd db, we should create
a class that inherits the ModelBase class in valence/db/models.py.

.. NOTE::
      If timestamp info is needed for this model,
      please inherit ModelBaseWithTimestamp class instead.
i.e.

  .. code-block:: python

    # valence/db/models.py

    class ExampleModel(ModelBase):

        # This is the Etcd dir the new model lives in
        path = "example_model"

        # The fields will be wrapped as a value for one object
        fields = {
            'uuid': {
                'validate': types.Text.validate
            },
            'name': {
                'validate': types.Text.validate
            },

        }


Add a driver for model
----------------------

Etcd driver definition is in the file valence/db/etcd_driver.py.

Considering adding operations for one example model,
we should create a class in valence/db/etcd_driver.py.
i.e.

  .. code-block:: python

    # valence/db/etcd_driver.py

    @six.add_metaclass(singleton.Singleton)
    class ExampleDriver(object):

        def __init__(self, host=config.etcd_host, port=config.etcd_port):
            self.client = etcd.Client(host=host, port=port)

        def get_example_object(self, object_id):
            pass

        def create_example_object(self, values):
            pass

There should be more guides to be continued later.
